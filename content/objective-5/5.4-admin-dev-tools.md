We have covered most of the admin tools already in different topics. Let's summarize them together.

Admin development tools are located in the System Configuration > Advanced > Developer.

See: [DevDocs - Developer](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/advanced/developer.html)

**Most important are:**
* Server-side vs client-side less compilation
* Allow symlinks - which allows simpler and faster development
* Template hints
* JavaScript bundling and minifying
* CSS merging and minifying
* Sign static files
