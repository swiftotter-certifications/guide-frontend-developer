## 3.03 Demonstrate the ability to override or extend Magento LESS

**How to override a LESS theme file:**

We need to modify the availability notice on the product page. The merchant has requested that this text is very large and prominent on the page. You have already created the SwiftOtter/Flex theme. How do you update the font size for this element?

Since this is a small change, the best might be to leverage `_extend.less` by creating one in `app/design/SwiftOtter/Flex/Magento_CatalogInventory/web/css/source/_extend.less`.

However, if this is the first of a litany of changes, override the LESS file.

To do this, copy [`vendor/magento/theme-frontend-luma/Magento_Catalog/web/css/source/_module.less`](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.4-develop/app/design/frontend/Magento/luma/Magento_Catalog/web/css/source/_module.less) into `app/design/SwiftOtter/Flow/Magento_Catalog/web/css/source/_module.less`. Modify the necessary code. Clear `var/view_preprocessed` and `pub/static` and refresh the page.

There are no ways to "extend" a less file per se (i.e. create another less file that will merge with the original one). However one may "extend Magento LESS" in a way of adding new less files, override variables, and so on. This functionality is described in Section 3.2 of the current guide.
