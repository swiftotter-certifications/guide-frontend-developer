## 3.05 Demonstrate the ability to style emails

### Common styles

General styles common for all emails are located in the email.less file. You have a few options to customize:
* You can customize emails by adding `_email.less`, `_email-variables.less` and so on (see the link below for the full list).
* You can always override email.less files using the standard fallback rules.

Specific styles:
* For a given module, you may specify _email.less file that contains styles specific to the emails owned by the module.
* In the template you can include CSS instructions like this:
    ```html
    <style type="text/css">
        {{var template_styles|raw}}
    
        {{css file="css/email.css"}}
    </style>
    ```
