## 6.04 Define Grunt setup and usage

**Points to remember:**
* Task runners are nodejs modules that may automate some processes, primarily related to less (sass) compilation and simplify development process.
* Magento supports grunt out of the box, although other task runners could be used as well.
* Grunt configuration files are located in the `dev/tools/grunt/configs` directory.

Prior to configuring grunt, one must install `nodejs`, `npm` (or other node package manager) and install grunt's `node` package.

In order to configure grunt, you can specify your theme in the `dev/tools/grunt/configs/local-themes.js` file.

See [Using Grunt](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/frontend-dev-guide/tools/using_grunt.html) for details.

Using grunt one may perform the following tasks:
* Compile less
* Symlink static assets
* Clean preprocessed files
* Watch changes in less files and recompile on the fly (probably the most useful feature)

See [Compile LESS Using Grunt](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css_debug.html) for details.
