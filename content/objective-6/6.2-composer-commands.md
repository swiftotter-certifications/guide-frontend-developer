## 6.02 Describe the usage of Composer commands (install, update, require, remove)

Composer is a PHP tool that is used to manage packages (dependencies). Notes to remember:
* Composer's configuration is written in the `composer.json` file.
* Information about installed versions of the packages is written in the `composer.lock` file.
* All dependencies are installed in the vendor folder.

In what follows, we assume that composer software is installed on the server and globally available with the `composer` command.

Note that composer is using its own autoloader, see [Composer Schema - Files](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#files) and more generally [Composer Schema - Autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload).

### Composer install

The `install` command is used to download and install required packages (read from the `composer.json` file).

The syntax is: `composer install`

### Composer update

The `update` command pulls the latest versions of the installed packages and updates.

Syntax: `composer update`

It is also possible to update specific package(s) with `composer update vendor/package`.

**Important:** `update` can be dangerous, because current custom code may be incompatible with the latest versions of some packages!

### Composer require

The `require` will add a new record in the `composer.json` and install a new package. 

Syntax: `composer require vendor/package`

* [Composer Docs: Require](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require)

### Composer remove

The `remove` command removes a package(s) from the `composer.json` file and then uninstalls the package(s).

Syntax: `composer remove vendor/package`
