### Describe how to use Magento modes.

See answer above for: "How does the application behave in different deployment modes, and how do these behaviors impact the deployment approach for PHP code, frontend assets, etc.?"

### What are pros and cons of using developer mode/production mode? When do you use default mode?

See answer above for: "How does the application behave in different deployment modes, and how do these behaviors impact the deployment approach for PHP code, frontend assets, etc.?"

Default mode is enabled out of the box. It is a hybrid of both production and development modes designed to be secure but also allow for some development capabilities.

### How do you enable/disable maintenance mode?

`bin/magento maintenance:enable`

`bin/magento maintenance:disable`
