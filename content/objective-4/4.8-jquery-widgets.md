## 4.08 Demonstrate the usage of jQuery widgets

### Demonstrate understanding of using jQuery

**Demonstrate understanding of jQuery and jQuery UI widgets.**

jQuery is a library to assist with JavaScript development while smoothing over browser inconsistencies. It had its place several years ago while Magento 2 was in development. [Here is an interesting discussion](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3886) about the future and place of jQuery.

Magento uses jQuery v3.6.0: 
* [jQuery.com](https://api.jquery.com/)
* [`lib/web/jquery/jquery.min.js`](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.4-develop/lib/web/jquery/jquery.min.js).

jQuery is famous for the `$('.element-selector').methodName(/* … */)` syntax. This snippet locates the HTML elements that match the selector and calls the fictitious `methodName` function on each. There are many other methods that can be called on the selector to modify its appearance or how it functions. jQuery is slightly less verbose than vanilla JavaScript, although this usually comes at a cost of browser performance.

jQuery UI widgets are an extension of jQuery that provides pre-built components for displaying common functionality. [Here are a list of core widgets](https://api.jqueryui.com/category/widgets/).

**Demonstrate understanding of how to use Magento core jQuery widgets.**

Magento includes a number of jQuery widgets that are available to customize the look of the frontend. The goal is to save development time by offering pre-built solutions to solve business requirements.

These are listed below in further reading.

DevDocs has good examples for how to utilize these widgets:
* [Confirmation Widget](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/javascript-dev-guide/widgets/widget_confirm.html)
* [Accordion Widget](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/javascript-dev-guide/widgets/widget_accordion.html)

**Further reading:**
* [DevDocs: jQuery Widgets](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/javascript-dev-guide/widgets/jquery-widgets-about.html)
* [jQuery.com: Widget Factory](https://jqueryui.com/widget/)

**How can jQuery UI Widget methods be instantiated?**

* Create a `require` method or a JS module with the `define` method.
* Specify the path of the module. For the confirmation widget, it would look like:
    ```
    require(['Magento_Ui/js/modal/confirm'], function(confirmWidget) { /* … */ });
    ```
* Utilize the widget by calling the function that was imported:
  * If the widget is independent of an HTML element: `confirmWidget(/* … */)`
  * If the widget affects an HTML element, you need to use the widget name as it was originally defined: `$('.element-selector').accordion({ /* … */ });`

**How does variable naming/scope work with RequireJS and Magento widgets?**

When a widget is defined, it will look something like this:

```
define([
  "jquery"
], function($) {
  $.widget("swiftotter.mywidget", {});
  return $.swiftotter.mywidget;
});
```

In the above code, we are exporting the newly-created widget from a RequireJS module. Here is where an important distinction is made. **When creating the widget, you assign its name to the jQuery object.** As such, that widget is callable from the jQuery selector.

However, the widget is **also** exported from the module. If you do not need to use the jQuery selector, you can import the widget and just use the name as imported.

```js
define([
  "jquery",
  "SwiftOtter_Flex/js/mywidget"
], function($, importedMyWidget) {
   $(".element-selector").mywidget(/* … */);
   /**
    * The above works as it is referencing the same name as specified when it was
    * created. This is because this widget needs to be attached to HTML element(s).
    */

  importedMyWidget(/* … */);
  /**
   * Calling the variable importedMyWidget works because that is what is defined in
   * this scope.
   */
}
```

**How can you call jQuery UI Widget methods?**

This answer is for widgets who are attached to an element.

```
$('.element-selector').accordion("activate");
```

The syntax is to execute the widget's name and pass, as a method argument, the name of the function you want to execute.

**How can you add new methods to a jQuery UI Widget? How can a jQuery UI Widget method be wrapped with custom logic?**

There are two ways to implement this. If the business requirements dictate modifying something already in use (like the product page tabs), a different approach must be used than if you are creating something new (and have the capacity to specify a new component).

We will address modifying an existing piece of functionality first. This is done by creating a mixin-a frontend parallel to interceptors (plugins).

**To override an existing Magento jQuery UI widget:**

```
//app/code/SwiftOtter/Test/view/frontend/requirejs-config.js

var config = {
    "config": {
        "mixins": {
            "mage/tabs": {
                'SwiftOtter_Test/js/tabs-mixin': true
            }
        }
    }
};
```

```
// app/code/SwiftOtter/Test/view/frontend/web/js/tabs-mixin.js

define(['jquery'], function(jQuery) {
    return function(original) {
        jQuery.widget(
            'mage.tabs',
            jQuery['mage']['tabs'],
            {
                activate: function() {
                    // your custom functionality here.
                    return this._super();
                }
            }
        );

        return jQuery['mage']['tabs'];
    }
});
```

Many thanks to [Alan Storm's article on this subject](https://alanstorm.com/modifying-a-jquery-widget-in-magento-2/) which makes it very clear on how to do this.

**Here is an example on how to add a new method to a Magento jQuery UI widget by creating a new widget that extends another widget:**

```
// app/code/SwiftOtter/Test/view/frontend/web/js/custom-tabs.js

define([
  'jquery',
  'jquery/ui',
  'mage/tabs'
], function($) {
    $.widget('swiftotter.customTabs', $.mage.tabs, {
        doSomething: function(input) {
            alert("Nothing like a good ol' fashioned ALERT in your face. " +
                    "Input value: " + input);
        }
    });
});
```

Then, in your PHTML template:
```html
// app/code/SwiftOtter/Test/view/frontend/templates/test.phtml
<div class="element-selector"></div>
<script>
require([
  'jquery',
  'SwiftOtter_Test/js/custom-tabs'], function ($) {
    $(".element-selector").customTabs();
    $(".element-selector").customTabs("doSomething", "hello");
    // this method demonstrates how to call a function on a widget
});
</script>
```
