## Introduction
You have taken the first step toward becoming a Magento 2 Certified Expert Frontend Developer by downloading SwiftOtter's study guide. 
We've worked hard to produce a quality annotated eBook. Now it's your turn to get to work improving your Magento 2 knowledge and your future.

**I do not recommend novices use this study guide, let alone take this test.** You will not be able to pass by having little experience and then reading this study guide. Instead, start with the Professional Developer test, pass it and **then** go for this test.

**If you are an expert, then this is the test for you (aptly named!).** Review this study guide. Actively work to prove me wrong (then let me know!). Assume that I'm lying through my teeth to you on every single page. I'm being hyperbolic here as I'm giving you the very best information I possibly can. However, you _must_ internalize every sentence written in this guide.

Magento is a world-class platform and highly skilled professional developers elevate the whole community. The better you are, the more everyone benefits.

The best way to pass the test is to know Magento 2.
* As you have questions, feel free to [ask in our Slack channel](https://certifications-hq.slack.com/) - the 2nd biggest Magento-focused Slack community. 
* The test is 50 questions and 100 minutes - 2 minutes per question. 
* The test questions are scenario-based. You are provided information and a
relevant question. You then choose the appropriate answer(s).
* There are three answers per question. Fewer answers does not make it easier. 

All the best!
